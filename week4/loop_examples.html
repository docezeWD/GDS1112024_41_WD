        We can write a function that loops. 
        This function will call itself if a condition isn't met
        There is NO NEED for us to do this!
        The for loop will do the same thing with less code
        Recursion is when a function calls itself. 
        It is tricky and dangerous to use recursion because you could easily end up in an infinite loop and break your program.
