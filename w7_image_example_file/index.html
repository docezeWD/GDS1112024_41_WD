        <p>
            This program demonstrates how to add a graphic to your GameObjects.<br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> <i>You only need to edit the game.js file, but you can and should look at the other two .js files.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
           The GameObject class includes a .graphic function to draw an image and a .img property that contains the information about the image. You can change the image by changing the .img object's properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            The object's img property is an object that contains the details about your image including the scale. The <i>.img.scale.x</i> and <i>.img.scale.y</i> are a percentages (a number between 0 and 1), while the <i>w</i> and <i>h</i> are pixel values. The image uses it's native size by default, so it's best to make your images the correct size to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
           This file also contains a menu state. The menu has a background object. You can create an image for the menu's background and button in photoshop. These would be two separate images.<br>
           <b>NOTE:</b> <i>The background for your game could work the same way</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the notes in the game.js file</li>
                <li>Comments labeled INSTRUCTIONS are the ones prompting you to write JavaScript</li>
                <li>Write your JavaScript below the INSTRUCTIONS comments</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>IMPORTANT:</b>DO NOT REMOVE <i>mrt.jpg</i> from the html or images folder. The game requires this default image to work
        </p>
        <p>
            The menu contains an example of drawing text on the Canvas.
